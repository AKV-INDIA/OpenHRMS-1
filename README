REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by OpenHRMS is that your Web server supports
PHP 5.1.0 or above. It has been tested with Apache HTTP server
on Windows and Linux operating systems.


QUICK START
-----------

Unzip the OpenHRMS file you have downloaded to your web server directory.

Download a copy of the latest release of Zend Framework from 
http://framework.zend.com. Unzip the file and copy the Zend folder
located in the library folder to your library folder on the
openhrms folder you unzipped in the previous step.

OpenHRMS utilizes URL rewriting so you may need to change your apache 
configuration.
Create a virtual host configuration and set document root pointing to the public folder on the openhrms
folder you had unzipped in step 1, otherwise OpenHRMS URL might break unexpectedly.
Sample configuration can be found at http://apptools.com/phptools/virtualhost.php
or try google for apache virtual host configuration. Just Make sure you documentRoot 
points to the public folder.

Import the database file openhrms.sql included in the folder into your 
mysql database.
Open the application configuration file located at 
OpenHRMS/application/configs and edit the database connection section on the file application.ini
to include your database connection credentials

Enter the URL to your OpenHRMS installation and use the credentials 
username: admin
password: admin
to login.
